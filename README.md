# FlowKit
FlowKit is a dynamic flow framework that tells to the client which screen/step the client should show and in which order.
Along with `FlowKit` there is `FlowKitAdditions`, a basic implementation that would allow you to use `FlowKit` directly without coding.

### Features
#### Dynamic flows
Client can retrieve the flow from `Backend`, it means that Backend could take about feature flags, country and all the possible conditions to have a flow and send to the client the flow to show. So all the complexity can be tested in the BE side easily.
By the other hand, you could also define `locally` the flow in a `JSON` file or `programmatically`, so you can unit test your flow.
#### Type safe
The compiler will advise you in case that you mix the things, the compiler will be your best friend.
