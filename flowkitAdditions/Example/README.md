# FlowKit Example App

The FlowKit Example App showcases how to use FlowKit and FlowKitAdditions in your project. 

## Run the project

Clone repository and run `pod install` in the example app folder.

## Structure & Content

The project is divided into two apps with examples of how to present a flow using [UIKit](https://github.com/n26/flowkit-ios/tree/main/flowkitAdditions/Example/flowkitAdditionsSwiftUI) and [SwiftUI](https://github.com/n26/flowkit-ios/tree/main/flowkitAdditions/Example/flowkitAdditionsUIKit)

All flows in the example app use [Local JSON files](https://github.com/n26/flowkit-ios/tree/main/flowkitAdditions/Example/Shared/FlowResponses) where you can see different responses.

We added an [Error handle example](https://github.com/n26/flowkit-ios/tree/main/flowkitAdditions/Example/Shared/Error/FlowErrorViewModel.swift) listing all possible errors FlowKit throw.
